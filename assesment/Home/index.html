<p>We’re not stopping at ManHunt! Our team is hard at work on even more exciting projects that will redefine what you can expect from immersive games. Here’s a glimpse at what’s coming next:</p>

<p>- <strong>Project Eclipse (2025):</strong></p>
<p>An open-world survival game that takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, where you must navigate an ever-shifting environment to gather resources, build alliances, and face off against dangerous enemies. Think of it as a blend of stealth, strategy, and resource management, but with a unique twist—dynamic environments that react to your choices.</p>

<p>- <strong>Project Anomaly (2026):</strong></p>
<p>A sci-fi thriller where you’re stranded on an alien planet, trying to escape hostile wildlife, an unforgiving terrain, and strange technology left behind by an ancient civilization. The game will feature co-op multiplayer, a first for our studio, allowing you to team up with friends to survive and uncover the planet’s secrets.</p>
